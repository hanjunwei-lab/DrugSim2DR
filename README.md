# DrugSim2DR: Predict Drug Functional Similarity to Drug Repurposing

> A systematic biology tool was developed to repurpose drugs via a drug-drug functional similarity network. 'DrugSim2DR' first predicts drug-drug functional similarity  in the context of a specific disease, and then using the similarity constructed a weighted drug similarity network. Finally, it used a network propagation algorithm on the network to identify candidate drugs.
